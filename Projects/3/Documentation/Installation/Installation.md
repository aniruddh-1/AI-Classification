# Installation & setup
The following guide will take you through setting up and installing the [AI-Classification](https://github.com/aniruddh-1/AI-Classification).

&nbsp;

# Prerequisites

## Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
For this Project, the operating system choice is [Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/ "Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS"). To get your operating system installed you can follow the [Create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#0 "Create a bootable USB stick on Ubuntu") tutorial.

## Python3 & Tensorflow2
Ubuntu 18.04 come with Python3 by default. You should be able to invoke it with the command in Shell:
```
python3
```
**The installation can be run on an existing installation of Ubuntu, however we recommend using a fresh installation.**
If you face any error or problem while running above command, follow the below commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
```
You can then invoke it with the command:
```
python3
```
Now install the required remaining Python libraries and Tensorflow2 on system by following shell commands:
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pickle-mixin
pip3 install os-sys
pip3 install times
pip3 install h5py
pip3 install random2
pip3 install tensorflow==2.1.0
pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==2.1.0
pip3 install tensorboard==2.1.0
```

# Clone the repository

Clone the [AI-Classification](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/AI-Classification "AI-Classification") repository from the [Peter Moss Acute Myeloid & Lymphoblastic COVID-19 AI Research Project](https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project "Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project") Github Organization.

To clone the repository and install the COVID19 AI Quantum Tensorflow repository, make sure you have Git installed. Now navigate to the location you want to clone the repository to on your device using terminal/commandline, and then use the following command.

The **-b "0.1.0"** parameter ensures you get the code from the latest development branch. Before using the below command please check our latest development branch in the button at the top of this page.

```
  $ git clone -b "0.1.0" https://github.com/COVID-19-AI-Research-Project/AI-Classification.git
```
Once you have used the command above you will see a directory called **AI-Classification** in the location you chose to clone to. In terminal, navigate to the **AI-Classification** directory, this is your project root directory.

## Developer Forks
