# Introduction

The **Peter Moss COVID-19 AI Research Project AI Classification** repository is a collection of open source Artificial Intelligence for COVID-19 detection/early detection created by our team. The projects in this repository focus on using AI for classifying COVID-19 using computer vision, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) & Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

# Projects

Below you will find details of the projects in this repository. Projects with HIAS = YES require an installation of [HIAS](https://github.com/LeukemiaAiResearch/HIAS "HIAS"), you will not be able to use HIAS projects if you do not have a server already up and running.
